			<h4>Mon Aug 29 11:34:26 PM MDT 2022 - Sleep:</h4>
			<p>Why is sleep, something necessary for our survival, so hard to get enough of? In our modern era it's not all that difficult to get food, air, and water, so why is sleep so elusive? You'd think we'd've figured it out by now but no, many of us are always struggling with sleep deprivation.</p>
			<p>At least in my case, it's often easier to stay up and listen to music than to be left alone in the silence with my thoughts. Man, I haven't had a good night's sleep in so long.</p>
