			<p>For those late-night rants and the mental breakdowns</p>
			<h4>Mon Sep  5 08:43:24 PM MDT 2022 - Distance</h4>
			<p>For some reason I have a deep burning desire to get far, far away from civilization. I want to go to the most distant places on our world and experience that immense level of solitude and peace. I want to go somewhere too far north for trees to grow, where significant chunks of the year are in endless daylight or permanent darkness. I want to expose myself to the wrath of our planet and the forces which challenge our mere existence. I want the challenge of surviving in a place humans were simply not meant to survive.<p>
			<p>Is it our purpose to challenge the world in this way? Why do I feel such a strong calling to this?</p>
			<h4>Fri Sep 2 11:25:04 AM MDT 2022 - Unemployment:</h4>
			<p>Contributing to the unemployment rate since 2016!</p>
			<h4>Mon Aug 29 11:34:26 PM MDT 2022 - Sleep:</h4>
			<p>Why is sleep, something necessary for our survival, so hard to get enough of? In our modern era it's not all that difficult to get food, air, and water, so why is sleep so elusive? You'd think we'd've figured it out by now but no, many of us are always struggling with sleep deprivation.</p>
			<p>At least in my case, it's often easier to stay up and listen to music than to be left alone in the silence with my thoughts. Man, I haven't had a good night's sleep in so long.</p>
