			<h3>Public Journal Thing</h3>
			<p>For those late-night rants and the mental breakdowns</p>
			<h4>Wed Oct 26 11:27:03 PM MDT 2022</h4>
			<p>What good is living when you can't even find success or satisfaction in the things that you are good at and passionate about? Why go on when it's just an endless uphill battle? I don't want to do this anymore. As far as I see it, I only have a few options. I can either give up with my academic and career dreams and work on trying to improve myself and understand myself better or I can keep crawling through this shit, pretending like I have everything under control and that I am going to keep progressing. It's starting to catch up with me. I'm tired of crawling through this shit, I'm tired of saying "I will" and "Tomorrow" and "Not yet" knowing very well those things will never happen and I'm never going to get there. Yes, I'm fairly smart and I think outside the box and I am good with some specific technical skills but none of those things I gained from work or school. I gained them from passion in hobbies and projects and personal interests. I gained them from following my heart and putting everything into those passions, but none of that experience came from what I'm "supposed to be doing". What am I supposed to be doing? I'm a terrible student and a terrible worker. My work ethic is shit and unless I can directly see a clear and quick meaningful and impactful benefit to doing something, I fail to even try. I've tried to try, I see the value in trying and I see the value in school and work. I deeply respect that value, but there's something wrong with me that just makes all that not work. I'm broken somehow and the years of therapy and support from various people haven't been able to fix it. In the past year or two I've been trying to fix myself but I've only barely come to realizing how truly fucked of a situation I'm in. I feel like a leech. I take every opportunity given to me and often blow it or don't give credit where credit is due or don't make up for people's time and financial losses. I feel sick to admit it. What am I supposed to do? I don't know if I'll ever find a solution to all this. I may just forever be a lost cause, wasted potential, wasted *time and money*. I hate feeling like this. I want to feel like I am doing something important with what I'm passionate about and I want to feel like I'm making a difference, if not in the world then at least in the lives of the people who are close to me. I don't know if I'll ever fulfill this however.<br>
			I'm going to leave this right here. Those of you who know me, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I've tried and I've failed. I've failed myself and worst of all I've failed all of you.</p>
			<h4>Tue Oct 18 12:34:46 MDT 2022 - Life</h4>
			<p>All the time and money just to keep ourselves alive.</p>
			<p>Life isn't even a guarantee yet if you just let yourself die or end your life, there's "something wrong with you"</p>
			<h4>Mon Sep  5 08:43:24 PM MDT 2022 - Distance</h4>
			<p>For some reason I have a deep burning desire to get far, far away from civilization. I want to go to the most distant places on our world and experience that immense level of solitude and peace. I want to go somewhere too far north for trees to grow, where significant chunks of the year are in endless daylight or permanent darkness. I want to expose myself to the wrath of our planet and the forces which challenge our mere existence. I want the challenge of surviving in a place humans were simply not meant to survive.<p>
			<p>Is it our purpose to challenge the world in this way? Why do I feel such a strong calling to this?</p>
			<h4>Fri Sep 2 11:25:04 AM MDT 2022 - Unemployment:</h4>
			<p>Contributing to the unemployment rate since 2016!</p>
			<h4>Mon Aug 29 11:34:26 PM MDT 2022 - Sleep:</h4>
			<p>Why is sleep, something necessary for our survival, so hard to get enough of? In our modern era it's not all that difficult to get food, air, and water, so why is sleep so elusive? You'd think we'd've figured it out by now but no, many of us are always struggling with sleep deprivation.</p>
			<p>At least in my case, it's often easier to stay up and listen to music than to be left alone in the silence with my thoughts. Man, I haven't had a good night's sleep in so long.</p>
