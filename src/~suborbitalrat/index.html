                        <p>Welcome to my shitty website. It's really not that interesting but you found yourself here anyway so feel free to look around if you'd like, or don't, that's fine by me too.</p>
                        <h4>Updates:</h4>
			<code><p>[1 Nov. 2022] My astrophotography data (stacked unprocessed fit images) are now available in <a href="astrowo/">astrowo/.</a> Have fun!</p></code>
			<code><p>[10 Oct. 2022] I am proud to announce the release of the successor to my previous Discord bot! supreme-robot has an actually working command handler, fewer lines of code, and less bash nonsense.</p>
				<p>The main feature of supreme-robot right now is the shared quote database that allows users to submit and retrieve "quotes" containing text or images from a database shared between users of the bot.</p>
				<p>If Daddy Torvalds is already in your server(s), then you are already on the latest version of supreme-robot. If you'd like to add it to your servers, you can do so <a href=https://supreme-robot.sbin.me>here</a>. Or if you'd like to see the source code or even run your own instance, you can go to the <a href=https://github.com/suborbitalrat/supreme-robot>GitHub repo</a>.</p></code>
			<p><code>[17 Sep. 2022] The solutions of Obama Solutions! <a href=solutions/>Check it out!</a></code></p>
			<p><code>[29 Aug. 2022] I added a <a href="thoughts.html">page for my dark depressing thoughts</a>.</code></p>
			<p><code>[25 Aug. 2022] Welcome to my shitty website I designed like 4 years ago and just today put on an ssl-enabled web server for the first time. Yeah I suck.</code></p>
