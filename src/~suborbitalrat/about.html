			<!-- We should like, enable cgi or something. -->
                        <p>I have many names given to me by the mortal Earth dwellers but on this site I go by 'suborbital', 'suborbitalrat', 'sbin', or just 'ka10'. I am <!--include virtual="/unlisted/bin/age.cgi"-->at least 4 in Earth human years and I like pineapple on pizza.</p>
                        <p>My hobbies currently include catching Earth worms on the sidewalk after a rainstorm and throwing rocks into bodies of water.</p>
                        <p>I use she/her or they/them pronouns.</p>

                        <h3>What I Don't Do</h3>
                        <p>I don't work and I don't play video games.</p>
                        <p>I don't go outside much but when I do, I don't return home for a long period of time.</p>
