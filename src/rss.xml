# Why we should starve Lenny to death.

While the topic of starving a human being until it fucking dies is pretty taboo, I cum today here to make you think otherwise. Let me introduce you to my friend Lenny, Lenny is a fucking retard who let <idk.so> die because he refused to pay the 20 dollars renewal fee so now we lost the fucking idk.so domain which was originally going to be this site but now if we want to use that we have to pay like 500 dollars to some globohomo corpo that wastes thousands of dollars a year buying up expired domains.

Due to this, I suggest the idea of letting Lenny starve to death.
