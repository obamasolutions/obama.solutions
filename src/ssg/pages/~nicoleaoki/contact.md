- discord: nikki#7554
- irc: nicoleaoki in libera.chat
- pictochat: Room A at the back of the Maccas, Mon-Fri 4pm to 7pm.

And for future reference:
- I'm the most active in Telegram (practically online all day), so please try to reach me there if you can.
- I get spammed pretty often so please make your first message start/end/be with the cap emoji (ðŸ§¢) or "UwU".
- I speak english and spanish
