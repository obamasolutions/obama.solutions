# nikki's /etc/

---

One of the most charming parts of the internet are finding those small-indie sites with some kind of corner where somebody stores/writes their own little things, from posts about their recent trip to the mountains to something like a guide to installing CS 1.6 on OS X. This page tries to catalogue and host similar things that I've made through out the years, I try to update this as often as I can, mainly as its my own little personal legacy on the internet.

I can't really describe what is here, as you can find things like a list of past personas I've used, or a button that gives you one of my favorite albums. There really isn't a set topic or anything. You're free to sit and click anything that interests you, but please try to "respect" what is here and have some kind of viewer discretion.

## articles

- [the journey of finding a new laptop](etc/newlaptop.zip) - a post where i decided to find a new laptop, archived and outdated to the point its now a ZIP file

## lists

- [names](etc/names.html) - usernames/names that i've used in the past, outdated and in the process of being rewritten to reflect the Nicole/Nikki/Nikoki rebrand

## toys

- [albums](etc/albums.html) - a little JS experiment that gives you the name, artist and sleevenote link to one of my favorite albums, archived but kept for the sake of reminding myself of reminding myself that I can't do anything right

## misc

- [nikki's contribuiting guidelines](etc/contributing.html) - imagine a .github CONTRIBUITING file that's actually good and in a form of a minimalistic website!!!
