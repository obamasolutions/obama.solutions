# who is nikki?

---

Hello, my name is Nicole, [I was born at the age of 0 in a hospital that still exists, I enjoy listening to avant-garde music and reheating Little Caesars Pizza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXDC4dhxvcg), and I decided to write a page where I kinda introduce myself with things like who I am, what I do, what I like, etc.

## about
Well, as I said earlier, my name is Nicole[Âª](etc/names.html). I'm a 15-year-old self-taught hardware engineer, designer, shitposter, writer and developer of sorts based in Mexico City. And yes, I've read the Cryptonomicon and I believe that I'm perfectly independent even though I can't get past something like [setting up an SSG](etc/articles/markdown-in-obama.html).

I love talking about public transport, fintechs/neobanks, [music](https://last.fm/user/kamikodev), cooking, free software (as in freedom), and telephony-related things.

I use they/them pronouns although you're free to use any you want (in Spanish, please use "el/ellos" pronouns as they're the de-facto neutral)

## work
I'm currently (non-professionally) working at [Estrelar](https://gitgud.io/estrelar) as a Lead Hardware Engineer and Designer, where I design and build all sorts of aerospace devices; right now I'm working on their Foxbox project which aims to provide basic telecom services (PSAs, WiFi, HAM repeaters, etc) in the event of a catastrophe, such as a hurricane, tsunami, earthquake, etc. And to ridicule Elon Musk for wasting millions of tax-payer's money in space debree.

Aside from that, I make all sorts of things, both professionally and as a hobby, but as of September 20th, I'm exclusively working on Project Chapultepec, an app/service that lets you use and manage your [Movilidad Integrada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjeta_de_Movilidad_Integrada) card with your phone. I'm currently in the prototyping stages to formally propose the idea with the Mexico City Government to get resources and "a greenlight" to continue development.

Aside from that, I'm known for a few things:
- Making the "This user is a registered sex offender" copypasta in Discord's About Me section
- Copying and pasting commands I found in Github into a shell script to pirate Sublime products [(Sublime-Bypass)](https://github.com/citizensixtynine/sublime-bypass)
- Ripping off Nanom's CSS stylesheet, rebranding it and adding SPCSS to it [(Neonette)](https://github.com/nicoleaoki/neonette)
- Being one of the reasons Matt A. Tobin quit the Pale Moon team (refer to Kiwi Farms v. Moonchild)
- #1 Most Autistic Phlog Pyro in Uncletopia (Atlanta and Dallas)
- Leading the search for the [Hitogata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9YjoSPcyPU) lost commercial, and searching for other lost media
- Among others things from the past, present and future...

## trivia
In the previous version of this site I had this section where I'd list all the things that I do in my free time but I kinda found myself stuck being only able to list those things, and I was stuck on the entire "list things" mindset so today I bring you this trivia list of things about me!
- I'm partially deaf on my right ear thanks to HSBC not knowing how to setup a security system.
- My favourite brand of chips are Sabritas's Receta Crujiente Flaming Hot chips, specially when you put some Salsa Valentina mixed with Worcestershire sauce, a little bit of garlic powder and some tomato paste (trust me, it tastes amazing when you do that).
- I'm not Nanom, stop saying I'm Nanom.
- Nicole Aoki is a play-on-words on "Nikki" which itself is a play-on-words on the Fiat 126 (Niki); my favourite car.
- I have autism (both literally and figuratively).
- My favourite movies are "Catch Me If You Can" (english), and "Conozca la cabeza de Juan Perez" (spanish)
- I have over 30 emails and counting, don't try to block me :^)
- My favourite drink is Delaware Punch, a soda that is only available on Mexico for some reason.
- I have incredibly thick thighs, you should ask [@lexisother](https://github.com/lexisother) about that.
- My life goal is to take a shit outside 8 Canada Square
- I wish I lived in Monterrey (or Linburg)
- My favourite game is Team Fortress 2, and yes, I'm an Engineer main.
- I'm banned from an Kebab Restaurant in Iran because I trolled the pedophile owner to the point he recorded himself crying for mercy
- My favourite programming language is Zig.
- I'm perfectly able to transcribe the Cyrilc alphabet, but I can't read Russian.
- I have the knowledge to manufacture all sorts of medications (specially HRT) at home but I'm incredibly lazy and broke to do so.
- My favourite food is Spaghetti, specially when I cook it. (Unintentional 15 Seconds of Bora reference)
- My first crush on someone was with Neil Ciciriega and we do not talk about that.
- I'm a Mossad agent, and this has been a 6 month study conducted by Harvard University, please like and subscribe.
- Max Headroom's personality is what goes inside my head, turns out Mr. Headroom really likes taking up headrooms.

## keys
GPG: Kris Null - (krisnull@cock.li, citizensixtynine@protonmail.com, kris@memeware.net, nikoki@riseup.net and nikki@doge-mail.net) - 128A F60D 71DB D11F CEBF - [download](keys/public.asc)
SSH: palemachine - [download](keys/palemachine.pub)

Notes about me and signing/encrypting: 
- Github commits are signed using Github's key provided when you commit using their Desktop client or Web UI, but Gitlab/Codeberg/etc commits are ALWAYS signed using my GPG key.
- Keybase and Protonmail both use separate keys, can't swap them or anything so they're staying that way I guess.
- I do not use Keyservers, at some point I uploaded my key to MIT's keyserver but didn't generate a revocation certificate, the key there is outdated and does not include the new User IDs attached to it; **do not use it**.
- As of 2022, my laptop's hostname is `chinkbook`, not palemachine. But the SSH key still works so I don't give a fuck.
- I rarely sign emails (unless using Proton), and when I do there's normally an abnormal reason behind it, so watch out for those.
