# who is kris?

---

Hello, my name is Kris, [I was born at the age of 0 in a hospital that still exists, I enjoy listening to avant-garde music and reheating Little Caesars Pizza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXDC4dhxvcg), and I decided to write a page where I kinda introduce myself with things like who I am, what I do, what I like, etc.

## about
Well, as I said earlier, my name is Kris[Âª](etc/names.html). I'm a self-taught hardware engineer, designer, shitposter, writer and developer of sorts. I was born in the mid-2000s in Mexico City where I've lived all my life in.
I love talking about public transport, fintechs/neobanks, [music](https://last.fm/user/kamikodev), cooking, free software (as in freedom), and telephony-related things.

I use they/them pronouns although you're free to use any you want (in Spanish, please use "el/ellos" pronouns as they're the de-facto neutral)

## work
I'm currently working at Kritterhouse trying to pitch a mobility project to the Mexico City Governement, it is titled "Project Chapultepec" and is meant to expand upon the [Movilidad Integrada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjeta_de_Movilidad_Integrada) card introduced on 2019, by introducing mobile payments and in-app information.

I used to work at [Estrelar](https://gitgud.io/estrelar) as a Lead Hardware Engineer and Designer, where I design and build all sorts of aerospace devices; we sadly had to dissolve after our CEO turned into a glowie.

Aside from that, I'm known for a few things:
- Making the "This user is a registered sex offender" copypasta in Discord's About Me section
- Copying and pasting commands I found in Github into a shell script to pirate Sublime products [(Sublime-Bypass)](https://github.com/citizensixtynine/sublime-bypass)
- Ripping off Nanom's CSS stylesheet, rebranding it and adding SPCSS to it [(Neonette)](https://github.com/lordvesconte/neonette)
- Being one of the reasons Matt A. Tobin quit the Pale Moon team (refer to Kiwi Farms v. Moonchild)
- #1 Most Autistic Phlog Pyro in Uncletopia (Atlanta and Dallas)
- Leading the search for the [Hitogata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9YjoSPcyPU) lost commercial, and searching for other lost media
- Among others things from the past, present and future...

## trivia
In the previous version of this site I had this section where I'd list all the things that I do in my free time but I kinda found myself stuck being only able to list those things, and I was stuck on the entire "list things" mindset so today I bring you this trivia list of things about me!
- I'm partially deaf on my right ear thanks to HSBC not knowing how to setup a security system.
- My favourite brand of chips are Sabritas's Receta Crujiente Flaming Hot chips, specially when you put some Salsa Valentina mixed with Worcestershire sauce, a little bit of garlic powder and some tomato paste (trust me, it tastes amazing when you do that).
- I'm not Nanom, stop saying I'm Nanom.
- I have autism (both literally and figuratively).
- My favourite movies are "Catch Me If You Can" (english), and "Conozca la cabeza de Juan Perez" (spanish).
- I have over 30 emails and counting, don't try to block me :^).
- My favourite drink is Delaware Punch, a grape-flavoured soda that is only available on Mexico for some reason.
- I'm perfectly able to transcribe the Cyrilc alphabet, but I can't read Russian.
- My life goal is to take a shit outside 8 Canada Square.
- I wish to some day be able to move to Monterrey, or Tartu; both are my dream cities to move to.
- My favourite game is Team Fortress 2, and yes, I'm an Engineer main.
- I'm banned from an Kebab Restaurant in Iran because I trolled the pedophile owner to the point he recorded himself crying for mercy.
- My favourite programming language is Zig.
- I have the knowledge to manufacture all sorts of medications (specially HRT) at home but I'm incredibly lazy and broke to do so.
- My favourite food is Spaghetti, specially when I cook it.
- I'm a Mossad agent, and this has been a 6 month study conducted by Harvard University, please like and subscribe.
- My favourite album is Leisure Seizure by Tom Vek.

## keys
GPG: Kris Pineda - krisp@sdf.org - FB49 83D7 8F2A CB7D - [download](keys/public.asc)
SSH: palemachine - [download](keys/palemachine.pub)

Notes about me and signing/encrypting: 
- Github commits are signed using Github's key provided when you commit using their Desktop client or Web UI, but Gitlab/Codeberg/etc commits are ALWAYS signed using my GPG key.
- I recently swapped keys due to my old one having way too many User IDs, and because I uploaded it to a bunch of keyservers without generating a revocation certificate. At the end, who doesn't want to start over?
- Due to that experience, **I do not use Keyservers**, get my key from here and call it a day.
- As of 2022, my hostname is `chinkbook`, not palemachine. But the SSH key still works so I don't give a fuck.
- I rarely sign emails, and when I do there's normally an abnormal/special reason behind it, so watch out for those.
