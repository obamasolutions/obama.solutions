# contacting kris (me, lol)

Contacting me is pretty straight forward, you can find me (and will probs always find me) in the same places.

- email: [krisp@sdf.org](mailto:krisp@sdf.org)
- telegram [@cyproterone](https://cyproterone.t.me)
- discord: lagtrain#7554
- irc: nicoleaoki in libera.chat
- pictochat: Room A at the back of the Maccas, Mon-Fri 4pm to 7pm.

And for future reference:
- I'm the most active in Telegram (practically online all day), so please try to reach me there if you can.
- I get spammed pretty often so please make your first message start/end/be with the cap emoji (ðŸ§¢) or "UwU".
- I speak English and Spanish.
