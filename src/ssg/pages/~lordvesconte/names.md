# Explaining who is who (etc/names).

Hello, I'm Nicole, well, that's what I prefer you to call me when reading on *this* site, but when it comes to reading me in other sites like [Gitgud](https://gitgud,io/kris). You'll find that I use another name, this being Kris. And to that you may ask yourself some questions, such as:

- Is this the same person?
- What relation does Kris and Nicole have?
- Why the names?

Which are completely valid questions that cause genuine confusion, because of this, I've decided to write an article explaining the reason/history behind this, and "setting in stone" who I am so I can always forward this for the next time I get asked things like these.

## A little backstory

If you've known me for a while (ie, more than 2 years), you probably know that I've been known by a lot of names, among these you may find names like:

- Mitzi
- Lagtrain (and its derivatives like Lag!)
- Rando
- Adrien 
- among others...

The reason for this dates back to a conflict I was involved in on 2019 regarding a desk-warrior Discord group, which lead me to get doxxed, harrassed and eventually hacked after revealing that I had been dealing with personal identity issues, due to this I abandoned all my old accounts, and started a new online presence under the name of "Rando".

### Rando

**Rando** was my first real venture into the English-speaking side of things for things that I was invested in like Discord bots, a certain TV show about a paper company in Scranton, PA, and operating systems (more specificly, Winblows), for a while it all went well and even started to experiment more with my own identity, and also started to spend more of my time talking to people from other communities. But as I spent more time in some communities, I started to earn a name for myself, more specifically on the **Microsoft Discord** server, which became my "home server" for a while. As I had already consildated myself as an active member, and talked to more people in there resulting in more friendships, the owner of the server came back from the military or something, completely unaware of my existance and overall who I was. This became an issue as time went on as I started to open up more to those in my social circle (most of who were on the MS discord), which the owner didn't think of as "normal" because to him I was just a new member who for some reason was talking about changing names and using new pronouns. Due to this, the owner started to act (in what I saw) hostile against me, questioning me for things like "Why are you asking things like this" while talking to some friends, and sometimes just muting me out of nowhere while joining a discussion (refer to #unix discussions). After a while, I had a breakdown due to recent events happening in my life, which lead me to me deciding to "come forward" about the abuse in the server, something various users agreed along with, the owner's reaction was to start harrasing me for my identity issues and insulting me, at the end of the day the admin team joined along the harrasment and I ended up getting banned. After this I went into a depressive state in which I tried to end my life, but which I managed to get out of, but at the end, I felt that the only appropiate action going forward was to abandon Rando behind and start over again, just like I did in early 2020.

### CITIZENSIXTYNINE (Kris)

After experimenting for a while with my incredibly small friend group that I had, I landed upon the name **Kris**; along side with the username **CITIZENSIXTYNINE** after joking about the documentary about Edward Snowden titled CITIZENFOUR. I opened some accounts and got to find a new home server, in this case, I ended up settling in the now-defunct **Durov's Chat**; a Telegram group chat made by the creator of Telegram, *Pavel Durov*, to discuss his posts on the *@durov* channel, something that didn't really serve its purpose as it became more of a casual chit-chat community chat in which I spent a lot of time in, while also venturing in other things like Discord client mods through the Powercord (lmao rip bozo) Discord server.

As I spent more time in these communites, I started to work on own personal projects which eventually lead to the creation of Kritterhouse; a then-*for-cause* software development collective focused on repurposing the [DeadDrops project](https://deaddrops.org) for educative purposes, this eventually folded due to me not having enough time to dedicate to the project and because I recently started to pickup other hobbies (refer to *Lagtrain*). and founded Estrelar and Obama Solutions to work on projects along long-time friend [@suborbitalrat](https://obama.solutions/~suborbitalrat).

The name got phased out in September 1st, with it only remaining active for Estrelar-related things and using it IRL.

### Lagtrain (and Mitzi)

While I was working on Kritterhouse's projects, I happened to started playing the somehow-alive and older-than-me game, Team Fortress 2 because of my then-friend group thanks to the *@everyone* Telegram groupchat, as I played more and more, I started earning a name for myself under various names I used at the time as a "sub" for Kris (such as *KamikoDev*, *mexicanmcflurry* and others). Due to this I made a new separate persona called **Lagtrain** (or **Lag** for short, stylized as *Lag!*) to join into semi-casual servers like Uncletopia. As I started to perfect my playstyle, I had the idea to become a Jukebox (self-coined term for a music micspamming player with user-interaction to request songs among other things), this made me earn a name in Skial servers (which I got muted and called out for), as time went on I left the game after personal issues made me have less time to play, and after I lost internet access at home in May 2022.

After that, the name Lag has remained dormant... for now ;)

### Nicole Aoki (Nikki)

Although I have not mentioned this here, I tend to switch up my usernames pretty frequently (by using a Branch A & Branch B system to keep a balance), eventually I landed in the name **Nikki** because of the Fiat Niki car. At the time I didn't really think a lot about it, only treated it as yet another stepping stone like *Maku*. This changed when I got in the iPhone sideloading-scene in which I decided to make a backup Apple ID account to test things on, because I didn't have any names to "throw away", I decided to make a play-on-words on *Nikki* and came up with **Nicole Aoki**. 

The name didn't really had any use aside from being used to develop and test iOS apps with, but after some time, I decided to deprecate the name *Kris* due to me being known as *Nikki* in most places, so in September 1st, I decided to switch over to *Nicole Aoki* with the excuse of me wanting to try something new, and because on my recent venture on Discord client modding (which lasted days lmfao).

This name is currently what is being used for most things, I plan to deprecate it some day to replace it with a name that I've been "going stealth" with for a while, but recently I've considered going back to using the name Kris a few times.

## Future of the names

As I mentioned before, I already have planned to deprecate *Nicole Aoki* at some point, but due to recent events I've been planning on going back to using the name Kris for "public" purposes due to an upcoming project that I've been working on for the Mexico City Government.

I'm writing this on October 5th, so things might have changed in the time that this actually gets published, with that said, never be afraid to reachout to me and ask questions!
