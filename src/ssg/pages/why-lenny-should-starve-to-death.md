this is a test to see how our SSG setup works, so far we've learned a few things:
- based-ssg does not follow "standard" markdown
- bonsai fucking works after being abandoned 8 years ago (reeks of CVEs and abandoned packages though)
- there is a ssg written in elixir by someone who dissapeared in 2016
- lenny couldn't pay 60 dollars for idk.so, 30 bucks more than what we thought it would cost but he could have donated the damn thing to suborbital so here we're, domainless (well, atleast we have obama.solutions and foxbox.gay) and idk.so-less thanks to cocksucking lenny.

# Why we should starve Lenny to death
## An article to test our SSG setup and to ridicule Lenny publicly.


While the topic of starving a human being until it fucking dies is pretty taboo, I cum today here to make you think otherwise.

Let me introduce you to my friend Lenny. Lenny is our fellow retard at idk.so, what is idk.so may you ask? Well, idk.so was a little project we had in mind using similar to what obama.solutions now is, a little closed friends-only ecosystem with user pages, email and cloud storage for us to use. But Lenny, being the fucking retard that he is, let idk.so die because he refused to pay the 30€ renewal fee. So we lost the fucking <idk.so> domain and now if we want to use that we have to pay like 1500€ to some globohomo corporation that wastes thousands of dollars a year buying up expired domains.

Another issue that lead us to considering Lenny starve to death is that one time we organized a sarcastic raid as "GNU Evangelists" on a Discord server, but due to Lenny being a homophobic racist retard with little to no brain cells, he started spamming antisemitic shit in chat and pinging trans people on the servers and telling them to off themselves. What originally started as a joke to get a quick laugh and maybe find a new group of friends got us banned and reported because Retard McGee can't control himself and acts as if every server is our old 2020 GC.

Oh and that time he told *a box of kittens* some fucked up things in Debian Unofficial (miss those days...).

Due to this, I suggest the idea of letting Lenny starve to death, or mailing a pipe bomb to his address, which is publicly available anyways.
