# About Us

We're Obama Solutions, A global collective made up by insurgents sharing one sole purpose, spreading autism in the milky way... well, that's what we like saying when introducing ourselves, but that doesn't explain anything and its just a cheapo tagline that everyone can shrug off.

So, let us tell you who we're, starting from our origins; and ending in our future, because we know damn well we're dying before we turn 30.

### What shithole did we crawl out of?

Obama Solutions was consolidated sometime in 2021 ('20?), as a joke when we were searching for domains for an unrelated project, that was when we found that "obama.solutions"  was available. So we started joking about having a website called *"Obama Solutions LLC"* where we'd "offer" services such as "Last-Mile Hitman", "Drone Strikes on the Cheap", "Starvation of K-12 students"; among other sarcastic fictional services, so we registered our flagship domain, [obama.solutions](https://obama.solutions) and got to work.

At first we didn't really have any plans with the domain, aside from that website, hosting a Minecraft server and maybe having an email service (foreshadowing for a future project!). Our plans with the domain were so simple that we practically forgot about it, so we just scrapped them, we had a Minecraft server we ran for a while; but it was short-lived, and our website idea was so pathetic we didn't even care to do it anymore. So we decided to pull the plug on Obama Solutions and forget about it.

### Ok, so you bought a domain and didn't use it, now what?

While we didn't really feel like working on a stupid Minecraft server or a SMPLive/"Osama Bin Laden" joke site, we did have a lot of personal projects that we wanted to do together, because of that we decided to start [Estrelar](https://gitgud.io/estrelar), a small aerospace startup to publish/work on our aerospace projects... but that's the thing, Estrelar was founded to be an aerospace company, not a little skiddly-doodly RP collective to make useless tools that nobody but us are going to use.

It was then when we remembered about Obama Solutions, we had a domain, a server and a lot of ideas, so... why not start it up again?

### That's cool and all but, *what now*?

Well, we're here. We're Obama Solutions, and we're currently working in somethings that you'll like (or hate, you're welcome Mojang), but we think it's best to hold onto them for a while, but all you need to know is that we're here; and we're ready.

### Woooow, you sounded just like a shitty startup from San Francisco, but *what's next*?

As we said earlier, we're working on a lot of things, some that you may love and some that you may hate. It's all just a matter of time for them to come out of the oven, but if you want some description on some, well, here you go:

- An Incredibly Neat, Secure, Unique, Retarded, Gay, Esoteric, New and Terrible mail service (Project INSURGENT - I swear it's not another cock.li or Riseup clone)
- Seems that in-game reporting isn't enough, Mr. Nadella. (Seethenheimer - Free, Libre and Open Source Copenheimer for everyone to use, even 9-year-old Jimmy!)
- EILEAN SETUP THE FUCKING SSG ALREADY (SoGGy - Lightweight in-house SSG)
- and more fun stuff...
