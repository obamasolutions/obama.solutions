# Why we should starve Lenny to death
## An article to test our SSG setup and to ridicule Lenny publicly.

While the topic of starving a human being until it fucking dies is pretty taboo, I cum today here to make you think otherwise.

Let me introduce you to my friend Lenny. Lenny is the former owner of idk.so, what is idk.so may you ask? Well, idk.so was a little project i had in mind (that Lenny did not agree to) using similar to what obama.solutions now is, a little closed friends-only ecosystem with user pages, email and cloud storage for us to use. But Lenny, being the fucking retard that he is, let idk.so die because he refused to pay the $60 renewal fee. So we lost the fucking <idk.so> domain and now if we want to use that we have to pay like 1500â‚¬ to some globohomo corporation that wastes thousands of dollars a year buying up expired domains.

Another issue that lead us to considering Lenny starve to death is that one time we organized a sarcastic raid as "GNU Evangelists" on a Discord server, but due to Lenny being a homophobic racist retard with little to no brain cells, he started spamming antisemitic shit in chat and pinging trans people on the servers and telling them to off themselves (which is unfathomably based). What originally started as a joke to get a quick laugh and maybe find a new group of friends got us banned and reported because Retard McGee can't control himself and acts as if every server is our old 2020 GC.

Oh and that time he told *a box of kittens* some fucked up things in Debian Unofficial (miss those days...). (Lenny does not remember this but it was probably based)

Due to this, I suggest the idea of letting Lenny starve to death, or mailing a pipe bomb to his address, which is publicly available anyways.

(Note, as much as we hate Lenny, our lawyers told us to add this warning that we do not mean that "starving people to death" thing and that we do not mean any calls-for-violence to Lenny or his physical mailbox (you can still spam him at jaakleugos@gmail.com or whatever the fuck his email now is). And that is a test page to test our SSG setup, learn more about this [here](https://obama.solutions/~nicoleaoki/articles/markdown-in-obama.html))
