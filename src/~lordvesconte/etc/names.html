	<h1>names</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>I've been online for exactly 10 years as I'm writing this, which means that I've used a good chunk of usernames/alteregos through out my web surfing. This site contains a few of them that I consider somewhat "important" in case somebody from the past ever tries to reach out to me, and because acknowledging who I used to be is somewhat mature I guess.</p>
	<p>Due to privacy reasons and some personal issues that I'm still going through, I've purposefully ignored some names, so if one is missing, you already know why. Also, names are ordered from "most recent/in use" to "least used/banished into the shadow realm".</p>
