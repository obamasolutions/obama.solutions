		<h1>Who is nikki?</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>Hello, my name is Nicole, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXDC4dhxvcg">I was born at the age of 0 in a hospital that still exists, I enjoy listening to avant-garde music and reheating Little Caesars Pizza.</a></p>
		<p>I'm currently working/wasting time as a <abbr title="Lead Hardware Engineer">Lead HWE</abbr> and Product Designer at <a href="https://gitgud.io/estrelar">Estrelar</a>, making cool aerospace stuff, without a license of course (can't lose one if you don't have one!). While on my free time I like tinkering and playing with a lot of things.</p>
		<p>I also used to work as a freelance video editor, it was fun for a while but it eventually became a toll on my mental health and eventually I practically gave up on doing stuff.</p>
		<h2>list of Hobbies/Things I do on my free time.</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Whine about how Mexico City has the best public transport in the world (Metrobus Masterrace)</li>
			<li>Play Team Fortress 2 (I have over 300 hours and I don't plan to stop)</li>
			<li>Browse for houses in sale even though I can't afford any of them</li>
			<li><a href="https://twitter.com/lordvesconte">Shitpost in Twitter every thought that enters in my head</a></li>
			<li>Shitpost on /g/ about how Firefox is the best browser ever made (it is... well not anymore but its still funny)</li>
			<li>Hunt for pedophiles in Telegram</li>
			<li>Learn something new and completely forget it in a month</li>
			<li><del>Send pipebombs with racial slurs to my mate Matt</del></li>
			<li>Go for really long walks</li>
			<li>Writing essays that nobody will ever read!</li>
			<li>Think about things that mentally stable people normally don't think about</li>
			<li>Become obsessed with a band for like a week and then forgetting they existed (Sorry Franz Ferdinand)</li>
			<li>Recite whole-ass albums from memory (I'm good at remembering lyrics but not important details of my life!)</li>
			<li>Make "disposable" arguments for no reason outside of causing turmoil</li>
			<li>Develop projects that I will abandon in a week</li>
			<li>RUSH üêù</li>
			<li>Datamine games that I really like (or hate)</li>
			<li>Search for Lost Media (I was part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9YjoSPcyPU">Hitogata</a> search!)</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>keys (gpg/ssh)</h2>
		<p>Although I don't really encrypt/sign things often, I do tend to sign things like <a href="contributing.html">Git commits</a> and some emails (mainly work-related), due to this I'm leaving both my GPG and SSH public keys here so that you can verify when an email/commit/message/etc is coming from me.</p>
		<p>GPG: Kris Pineda - (kris@memeware.net and citizensixtynine@protonmail.com) - 2756 699D C883 0502 ACEB - <a href="keys/public.asc">download</a></p>
		<p>SSH: palemachine - <a href="keys/palemachine.pub">download</a></p>
		<p>Github commits may be signed using my Github's account/default key, Gitlab commits however, will ALWAYS be signed using my GPG key.</p>
