	<p>I really like listening to music, <a href="https://last.fm/kamikodev">if you couldn't tell already</a>. That's why I had this idea of packing all albums that I really like into one JSON file that you can then load with the click of a button... and that's exactly what I did!</p>
	<p>Below, there is a box with a button that you can click and get the name, artist and <a href="https://sleevenote.com">Sleevenote</a> link to a random album in my <a href="albums.json">albums.json</a> file.</p>
