		<h1>nikki's little corner</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>One of the most charming parts of the internet are finding those small-indie sites with some kind of corner where somebody stores/writes their own little things, from posts about their recent trip to the mountains to something like a guide to installing CS 1.6 on OS X. This page tries to catalogue and host similar things that I've made through out the years, I try to update this as often as I can, mainly as its my own little personal legacy on the internet.</p>
		<p>I can't really describe what is here, as you can find things like a list of past personas I've used, or a button that gives you one of my favorite albums. There really isn't a set topic or anything. You're free to sit and click anything that interests you, but please try to "respect" what is here and have some kind of viewer discretion.</p>
		<p>Also, this place is made to fit things that <a href="index.html">index/apex</a> can't, either because I'm too lazy to make new icons, make a flexbox and all that stuff. So as I said before, this place is extremely varied.</p>
