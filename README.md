### about

This repository fosters the source code of the most autistic website on the universe; it is written in pure HTML and CSS with some JS here and there. Some pages here are written in Markdown and have to be compiled using a static site generator (SSG), in our case we use [based-ssg](https://github.com/alloca123/based-ssg) by our fellow Alloca as it's lightweight as fuck and our small brains can't deploy something like Hugo.

Also, we practically tried to rip off [uwu.network](https://uwu.network) but it didn't really work out as we wanted it to, specially since we were using Asstro without any proper JS-dev experience, so we just "replicated" it using stock HTML+CSS and called it a day.

### deployment

All source code is stored in `src/`, you kinda just copy over all the things inside onto your `www/` folder on your webserver thing and load that.

As for based-ssg stuff I honestly have no fucking idea that's dealt with by suborbital.

### contributing

While we don't really expect you to contribute anything to this repository, you're welcome to come fix our shit for free. Just make sure to follow [our contributing guidelines](http://krisp.sdf.org/contributing.html) and "follow our coding style" or whatever the fuck that means; just try to picture 2 retards trying to make a website while sharing a single neuron and try to code like that.

### license

All source code here is licensed under the [YMGv2](https://github.com/citizensixtynine/ymg-v2) license, while some images are copyrighted and whatever the fuck, we honestly don't give a single shit about all that copyright stuff; if you're mad that we stole your shit, we recommend you to go seethe, cope and mald, then go send us an email over at <hello@obama.solutions> explaining your situation (we'll def not ignore you until you threaten to sue us).

### credits

We're like 2 people but I guess attribution is cool:
- [@nicoleaoki](https://github.com/nicoleaoki) for having the idea and making to begin with.
- [@suborbitalrat](https://github.com/suborbitalrat) for fucking up my commits and registering the obama.solutions domain.
